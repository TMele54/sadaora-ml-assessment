Looking for a dataset to use, candidates from kaggle are:

4. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasaanrana/diet-exercise-and-pcos-insights maybe something your risk of

7. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasparaj1/lung-cancer-dataset risk of
8. 

Ideas:

Given that the Newblazr Platform is currently focused on helping nurses navigate their careers, I want to do something 
specific to the nursing profession. CMS https://data.cms.gov/search has a wide variety of datasets focused on nurses,
and other factors such as compensation

Something like maybe:
Staffing level analysis, how support staff imppact a nurses lifestyle and health

Nurses who work the 12/14hr shifts from PBJ_Daily_Nurse_Staffing_Q2_2024.csv vs 8hr shifts
vs https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonytherrien/half-a-million-lifestyle to see how it impacts their
Stress Management, Time Management, Social Responsibility, Risk Tolerance, professional trainings (career growth)
given the amount of supporting staff per work location given here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cms/cms-pbj-daily-nurse-staggins-2017-2018


I need to explore:
